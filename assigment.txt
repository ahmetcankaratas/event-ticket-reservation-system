PROJECT TOPIC: ONLINE EVENT TICKET RESERVATION SYSTEM
PROJECT OBJECTIVE:
Develop an object oriented software application that allows users to search, reserve, and track
event tickets.
The application may be developed as a:
• Console application,
FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
1. Firm Operations
o Firms can create new events and define ticket details:
▪ Event name, date, location
▪ Ticket categories (e.g., VIP, Regular)
▪ Price per category
▪ Number of tickets available
o Event types must include concert, and at least two others (e.g., sports, theatre).
o Ticket prices can differ by category within the same event.
2. User Operations
o Users can search for tickets by specifying a time interval.
o The search results should display:
▪ Event date, location, ticket prices, number of available tickets
o Users can reserve tickets:
▪ If signed in with an account:
▪ Can view current and past reservations
▪ If not signed in:
▪ Can still reserve tickets
▪ A unique reservation number will be provided to track the
reservation
o On successful reservation, generate and show a unique reservation number
3. Data Persistence
o All data (e.g., users, events, reservations) must be persistently stored using:
▪ Local files (text or binary files), or
▪ A database (e.g., MySQL)
DELIVERABLES
1. Project Implementation
• A complete, working application developed using object-oriented software design
principles that satisfies all functional requirements. (Using Java is encouraged, but you
may choose any programming language.)
2. Project Report (PDF)
The report should include:
• Team Contributions Table
A clear contribution table showing what each member worked on.
• Usage Scenarios
Describe 3–4 typical scenarios of using the software Include relevant screenshots.
• UML Class Diagram
Show all major class definitions as UML class diagram.
• Explanation of Inheritance
Describe inheritance hierarchies used in the system.
• Explanation of Polymorphism
Explain where polymorphism is applied and why it is beneficial.
• Explanation of Data Persistence
Describe how data is stored and retrieved.
Mention the chosen method (files or database) and how it's used in your application.
3. Demo Presentation
Each team will give a short live demonstration of their project.
The demo date will be announced later
